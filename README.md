<h1 align="center">Hey there, nice to meet you - I'm Alicia :vulcan_salute:</h1>

<p align="center">
I'm a junior fullstack developer, currently completing a 16 week intensive bootcamp with School of Code.  I've worked in front of a computer all my life, at many jobs I didn't love - but I always enjoyed the sitting and the computer part.  So when the opportunity arose to train in the uber sit-at-a-computer job, I grabbed it with both hands - and I am never looking back! 
</p>
<p align="center"> 
Outside of coding/learning to code, you'll find me writing stories, listening to music, going out for breakfast, and the occassional living room disco when I have the house to myself.  But I also enjoy a good Netflix binge, I'm not gonna lie :wink:

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here are some ideas to get you started:

âš¡ Fun fact: I dread being asked fun facts/interesting things about myself.  I forget everything I've ever done or liked or achieved in my entire life, and I want a hole to open in the ground and swallow me.
<br>
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: code!  I'm a School of Code Bootcamp 12 bootcamper, and at two weeks in I'm starting to feel very pleased with myself indeed when I accomplish something :grin:
<br>
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with: probably most things, still.  Always.  Just keepin' it real, yo lol
