âš¡ Fun fact: I dread being asked fun facts/interesting things about myself.  I forget everything I've ever done or liked or achieved in my entire life, and I want a hole to open in the ground and swallow me.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning: code!  I'm a School of Code Bootcamp 12 bootcamper, and I'm only 1000% intimidated at this point, 11 days before we begin :grin:
